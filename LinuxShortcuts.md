# 🥷 Terminal Ninja: Linux Shortcuts & Pro Tips

Ayy, let's get you moving like a ninja in that terminal! Since you're on Mint, you've got some killer built-in shortcuts, plus you can make your own. Here’s the "pro-level" list to save you from typing like a scrub:

### 🏎️ The "Speed Demon" Navigation

Stop using the arrow keys to move one letter at a time; that's for amateurs! 

* 
**Ctrl + A**: Jump to the start of the line. 


* 
**Ctrl + E**: Jump to the end of the line. 


* 
**Alt + B / Alt + F**: Move back or forward by a whole word. 


* 
**Ctrl + W**: Delete the word before the cursor (massive time saver). 


* 
**Ctrl + U / Ctrl + K**: Nukes everything from the cursor to the start or end of the line.

### 🧠 The "I Forgot the Command" Fixers

* 
**Ctrl + R**: This is the GOAT; start typing a part of a command you ran yesterday, and it’ll find it. 


* 
**!!**: Run the exact last command again—handy if you forgot `sudo`. 


* 
**Tab**: Double-tap it to see all possibilities if you're stuck.

### 🛠️ Mint-Specific Custom Shortcuts

You can make a shortcut for anything, like opening your favorite script: 

* 
**Path**: Go to **Menu -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts** tab. 


* 
**Add**: Click **Custom Shortcuts** on the left and then **Add custom shortcut**. 


* 
**Define**: Give it a name (e.g., "Open My Script") and the command. 


* 
**Bind**: Click the "unassigned" row and hit your key combo like **Super + T**. 



---

🪟 Terminal Window Magic 

* 
**Ctrl + Alt + T**: Open a new terminal instantly. 


* 
**Ctrl + Shift + T**: Open a new tab inside the same terminal. 


* 
**Ctrl + Shift + C / V**: Copy and Paste—regular `Ctrl+C` kills the process! 



---

### 💡 Pro Tip: Unfreeze Your Terminal

* 
**The Problem**: If you accidentally freeze your terminal with **Ctrl + S** (XOFF), don't panic! 


* 
**The Fix**: Just hit **Ctrl + Q** to unfreeze it—no shit, it's a life saver!
